[{"question": "Which is the correct side chain? ", "type": "many_choice", "answers": [{"answer": "Tyrosine", "correct": false, "feedback": "Incorrect"}, {"answer": "Proline", "correct": false, "feedback": "Incorrect"}, {"answer": "Histidine", "correct": false, "feedback": "Incorrect"}, {"answer": "Tryptophan", "correct": true, "feedback": "Tryptophan residues are the easiest of all to identify. It is much larger than any other residue, has good density because of its rigidity, and possess a distinctive flat geometry due to the indole ring's aromaticity. When building, these residues can serve as handy landmarks to keep track of where you are working on the model while following along with the protein sequence."}]}]
