Unlike molecular replacement which introduces model bias, that does not happen when solving the structure using anomalous methods since they do not require a search model."}, {"answer": "The protein requires use of heavy metals like Hg, Pt, or selenomethionine derivatized proteins.  ", "correct": false, "feedback": "This can be problematic for a few reasons. One is that heavy metals are toxic, so it is important to be careful when using them. Another is that trying to incorporate heavy metals into a crystal either through co-crystallization or crystal soaking can haven negative impacts on the protein crystal seen in mosaicity or just outright damage to the crystal. Finally, selenomethionine derivatization is not always possible unless the protein can be grown in a model organism like methionine auxotrophic E. coli in minimal media where methionine has been replaced with selenomethionine.
