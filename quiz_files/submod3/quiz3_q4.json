[{"question": "Which is the correct side chain? ", "type": "many_choice", "answers": [{"answer": "Serine", "correct": true, "feedback": "This lobe of density is small so it can be difficult to tell what residue sidechain occupies it - even at this reasonably high resolution. For example, cysteine and alanine residues look similar, but the size of the sulfur atom on cysteine and the lack of density past the \u03b2-carbon can be helpful in determining the correct identity from the map alone."}, {"answer": "Cysteine", "correct": false, "feedback": "Incorrect"}, {"answer": "Alanine", "correct": false, "feedback": "Incorrect"}, {"answer": "Glycine", "correct": false, "feedback": "Incorrect"}]}]
