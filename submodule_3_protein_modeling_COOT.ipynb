    "## Overview\n",
    "Once diffraction data have been processed into an interpretable map model building can begin. Whether the data were anomalous, and a preliminary structure was built using AutoSol, or molecular replacement with a search model was used, the process of model building and refinement is the final step to acquiring a completed structure. For this section we will be using a molecular graphics program designed for macromolecular model building called the Crystallographic Object-Oriented Toolkit, better known simply as Coot. It can run on Linux, PC, and Mac platforms. Running Coot on a PC simply involves downloading and running a WinCoot.exe file. The easiest way to get Coot running on a Mac is to download the Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 (CCP4) suite of programs. CCP4 includes several programs used in macromolecular crystallography in addition to COOT and integrates well with Mac OS. It can also be installed using the software package manager Homebrew, but this is more complicated. COOT has been around since 2004 and has widely replaced other model building programs due to its ease of use and stability. Amino acids can be added, deleted, and structurally changed in accordance with the electron density maps calculated from x-ray data. The maps are used as a guide on how to position the atoms in the structure. Each residue in the structure is visually inspected and corrected as needed to match the electron density map. Once the model has been built it is refined in Phenix. The outputs of this refinement process are an improved structure and electron density maps. Then the process starts over until further improvements to the structure cannot be made. The final structure is then validated for deposit into the Protein Data Bank (PDB)."

    "**Step 2.1** - Load the .pdb file into COOT by choosing: <br>\n",
    "    `File -> Open Coordinates` \n",
    "+ Electron density maps are calculated using a .mtz file containing diffraction data. \n",

    "    `File -> Auto Open MTZ` \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2.3** - Observe the output. Two maps will appear, one with blue density, and another with green and red density. The blue map is called a 2FO-FC map and the green (positive) and red (negative) densities are from a FO-FC map, or difference map. The term FO  refers to phases taken from the observed data, which in x-ray crystallography is the diffraction data collected from crystals. The term FC refers to the phases calculated from the model that has been built. This can be done because any 3-dimentional structure can be converted to phases and amplitudes using a Fourier transform, just like how a Fourier transform was used to take phase and amplitude data to make maps and solve the structure. The first calculated structure was the model that resulted from solving the structure. It provides the phases for the FC portion of the 2FO-FC map. The 2 in front FO in the 2FO-FC map means the contribution of the observed phases is doubled and the minus sign shows that the calculated phases are subtracted. Ultimately what this map displays is where electron density is found in our structure. That map is used to build the atomic coordinates of amino acid residues and ligands like small molecules, ions, and water. An FO-FC map has less detail because it only shows where the observed and calculated phases differ. For example, if the observed and calculated data matched perfectly, this map would be completely empty. However, some areas of the observed and calculated phases differ slightly, so this kind of map can be useful for building in areas where the density from the 2FO-FC map alone is hard to interpret. In general, we use the Auto Open MTZ feature to quickly calculate electron density maps with the 2FO-FC map being used the most for model building. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2.3** - Once the model and maps have been loaded into COOT, hit the `space bar` to go to the first residue on the N-terminus which is a glutamate in position 7. <br>\n",

    "**Step 2.4** - Move the structure around in COOT by performing the following: \n",
    "+ Hit the `space bar` to advance the structure one amino acid residue forward.\n",

The scroll function allows the user to increase or decrease the map contour level (related to the signal to noise) of the map with a mouse.

    "### Step 8 - Adding and validating amino acid residues.\n",
    "The β-carbon of the newly added alanine is pointing into another lobe of electron density larger than the -CH3 sidechain. Therefore, we can see this residue isn’t alanine, so it will have to be changed. It is a good idea to keep the sequence of the protein handy to check what the correct amino acid is while building. The FASTA sequence for this protein is:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Step 9.2** - Choose CYS (C) and `click on the N-terminal Glu residue (often it requires clicking twice)`, and the cysteine residue will automatically be added. Since this map is very clear, the residue is added to the density with the correct orientation. However, in areas where the density is poor, adding a terminal residue may not position it correctly. We will see examples of this later, and when that happens the residue must be manually moved to the correct atomic positions using the electron density map as a guide. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 9.3** - After adding the cysteine residue, it appears that there is still some electron density not accounted for next to the sulfur atom. This is because this structure has a cystine crosslink, and the other cysteine residue has not been built into the structure yet. Once the other Cys residue has been added both Cys residues will automatically be crosslinked.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 9.4** - <u>Follow this procedure for every remaining residue on the N-terminus until the map is no longer interpretable</u>. Sometimes it is possible to build the structure to the first residue, but often the N-terminus is disordered, so many of these residues must be left out of the final structure. Occasionally, if the protein has a tag on the N-terminus such as a His-tag or SUMOylation, there will be residues past the first that can be built as well. The residue numbers will continue to decrease by one as additional N-terminal residues are built. This can result in a zero and negatively numbered residues for the purpose of keeping track of which residues are part of the protein sequence and which are part of the tag. Build as much of the structure as possible since all of it is part of the final structure that will improve refinement statistics and maps. \n",

    "**Step 9.8** - The `Real Space Refine Zone` feature can also be used for larger areas of the model that have to be adjusted. This is done by `clicking` on an atom on the *first* and *last* residues in the zone that needs adjustment. This will refine the entire zone between and including those two residues.

    "Through this submodule, you have gained critical skills in utilizing the Crystallographic Object-Oriented Toolkit (COOT), an essential tool for preparing a final model suitable for submission to the Protein Data Bank (PDB). You have learned to interpret electron density maps, refine structures, and appreciate the iterative nature of this approach. These competencies not only enhance your ability to contribute to high-quality structural biology research and equip you with the foundational tools and knowledhe to conduct your own future exploration and discovery. <mark>REVIEW</mark>"
