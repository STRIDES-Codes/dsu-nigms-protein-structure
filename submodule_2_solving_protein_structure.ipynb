    "## Overview\n",
    "Once the reflections from a diffraction experiment have been scaled, the next step is to use them to solve the structure. The .hkl file from SCALEPAK will be used for this purpose. The method of molecular replacement is used if there is an existing structure that is similar to the one you wish to solve. In the event there is not a model structure, it is necessary to use anomalous diffraction methods like Multi or Single Anomalous Diffraction which was covered in Submodule 1. Many programs have been written over the years to handle this task, but it is most convenient to have the software needed for this bundled into a suite of programs. In the past the Crystallography and NMR system (CNS) and Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 (CCP4) were valuable resources for protein structure solution. Currently, one of the most user-friendly software suites is Phenix. To quote the authors, “Phenix is a comprehensive software package for macromolecular structure determination that handles data from any of these techniques.” \n",

    "## Evaluating Diffraction Data\n",
    "After x-ray data are collected, we can evaluate the quality of the x-ray data. There are several parameters to consider which are defined below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Resolution: The smallest distance between crystal lattice planes that is resolved in the diffraction pattern1. What we see in the electron density is the lower the resolution the more closely the electron density maps match the structure model built. For example, at high resolution (<2.0 Å) maps look shrink-wrapped around the model and nearly all side chains are easily interpretable. At lower resolution (3.5-5.0 Å) It becomes difficult to discern between all but the largest residues. Helices look like tubes and strands meld together to look like sheets. However, the backbone trace of the polypeptide chain can still be seen clearly. \n",
    "\n",
    "R-factor: Average of mean difference between observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "$R_{sym}$: R-factor for symmetry related reflections. Rsym is calculated by looking at the intensity of a reflection and comparing it to the average intensity of symmetry related reflections. This process is done for all reflections in the dataset. Consider a reflection hi that is repeated four times in the data. Ih,i is the intensity of the i-th measurement of that reflection. Therefore, there would the Ih,1, Ih,2, Ih,3, and Ih,4. Using the equation below, if there were four reflections with intensities of 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, and 5.0 would give an Rsym value of 8.3%. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R_{sym} = \\frac{\\sum\\sum|I_{h,i}-<I_{h}>|}{\\sum\\sum I_{h,i}}|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The lower the $R_{sym}$ value the better the date.\n",
    "\n",
    "I/σ(I): Often called I over sigma, this is the signal to noise ratio of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Completeness^{2}$: The percentage of possible reflections that have been captured. Experimentally this is done by rotating the crystal in an x-ray beam to collect x-ray diffraction patterns. The rotation range in degrees needed for a complete dataset depends on the symmetry of the unit cell. For example, there are 11 point groups possible for protein crystals. A primitive, triclinic unit cell requires at least 180° rotation range, while a high symmetry cubic crystal can achieve a complete dataset with a range of just 35°. If the data are anomalous, each x-ray pattern can be collected followed by the next collected pattern at 180° away. This is to capture Friedel mates necessary to measure the anomalous signal, so a primitive triclinic crystal would need 360° to be complete. In practice, it is often best to collect as many frames as possible, since it is difficult to predict the exact number of frames necessary for complete data, and there are often blind regions in the crystal where reflections cannot be captured. \n",
    "\n",
    "Redundancy: This is the number of times the same indexed reflections were measured within a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mosaicity: A measure of the spread in size and orientation of unit cells within a crystal. Some amount of mosaicity is unavoidable. However, too much can cause reflections to overlap which can be seen in broadening of reflections in the x-ray pattern. Mosaicity can result from disorder as a result of crystal growth and is introduced when freezing crystals in liquid nitrogen or butane before x-ray data collection at cryogenic temperatures. \n",
    "\n",
    "One final consideration is that data statistics are broken up into resolution shells. Unsurprisingly, values like I/σ(I), $R_{sym}$, completeness, and redundancy get worse at higher resolution. This is in part because the intensity of the reflections fall off at higher diffraction angles. Often data collection statistics list an additional value in parentheses to show the corresponding parameter in the highest resolution shell. In the chart below the values of redundance, completeness, $R_{sym}$ and I/σ(I) are listed with another value in parentheses next to them. The numbers in parentheses are the respective values at the highest resolution shell, which for this example extends to 1.82Å. The actual shells are dived up during scaling, but at high resolution typically only span a few fractions of an Angstrom. \n",

    "In Submodule 2 we explored the pivotal processes involved in solving macromolecular structures using diffraction data. Starting from scaled reflections, we advanced through techniques such as molecular replacement and anomalous diffraction methods (SAD/MAD), emphasizing the practical application of these techniques through the Phenix software suite. With its user-friendly interface and comprehensive tools, Phenix provides user-friendly tools for structure determination in macromolecular crystallography. In module 3 we will take the solved structure and perform model building and refinement in COOT."
